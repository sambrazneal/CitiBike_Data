## Summary 

After analyzing the data, we found that the main users of the citi bikes are male subscribers to citi bikes. Bike users are more likely in the morning and evening times. This can lead us to believe that many people use citi bikes to get to and from their jobs during the week. We could conduct a survey of Des Moines residents to see if they would be interested in using a bike sharing service for their commute to work. 

Most citi bike trips are short lasting less than 20 minutes. It would be important to know the distance of Des Moines tourist attractions.
